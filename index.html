                <p>From here, like numbered cards can be moved to their match, as long as there are always five stacks. / ex. the 2 of Hearts and 2 of Clubs can be stacked, allowing you to flip over an additional card on 
            your bare pile.</p>
                <p>Your opponent will have the same setup.</p>
                <p>Put excess cards between players in an individual draw pile to each player’s right. This will be used throughout the game</p>

                <p>Counting “one, two, three: Spit,” each player flips over the top card from their draw pile, thus creating two center piles.</p> 
                <p>Players can then play cards from their own set-up into either of the center piles.</p>
                <p>Each card played should be one number or face value up or down from the top card of the center pile.</p>
                <p>Both players should have five stacks in their set-ups at all times, until they have less than five cards. Cards can be rearranged to achieve this.</p>
                <p>If neither player is able to use their set-up cards on the center piles, count again and flip a new card from each players’ draw pile onto their center pile.</p> 
                <p>Once a player has played all of their cards, both players can attempt to slap the smallest center pile.</p> 
                <p>Whichever pile a player slaps first will be absorbed into their deck.</p>
                <p>Use all of your collected cards to create a new set-up and play again.</p>

                <h1>When numbers get low...</h1>
                <p>Once one player does not have enough remaining cards to complete their set-up, they will play the round with less cards.</p> 
                <p>If a player does not have enough cards for a draw pile, the other player will flip their top draw pile card for the only center pile.</p> 
                <p>When the round comes to a close, slap the table where the second center pile would have been.</p>
                <p>The game is over when a player gets rid of all of their cards, and is able to slap the table.</p> 
                <p>The winning player will have no draw pile, no set-up, and no center pile to take in.</p>
